# Real-Time Data Ingestion System

## Overview

The SAR Aircraft Disappearance Prediction System includes a comprehensive real-time data ingestion module that fetches live aircraft telemetry and environmental data from free public APIs. This system is designed based on research from major aviation incidents (MH370, AF447) and incorporates SAR best practices.

## üéØ Research-Based Design

### SAR Research Foundations
- **MH370 Analysis**: Incorporates lessons learned about search zone prioritization and probability modeling
- **Time-Critical Response**: Research shows first 24-48 hours are critical for SAR success
- **Environmental Factors**: Wind drift, ocean currents, and terrain complexity affect search strategies
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Multi-factor validation ensures reliable simulation inputs

## üì° Data Sources

## üß† SAR Research Integration

### Aircraft Prioritization Algorithm
The system uses research-based criteria to prioritize aircraft for SAR simulation:

```python
Priority Score = Altitude Factor + Speed Factor + Time Factor + Geographic Factor

Where:
- Altitude Factor: Higher altitude = longer glide distance (0-10 points)
- Speed Factor: Higher speed = larger search radius (0-8 points)  
- Time Factor: Longer since contact = higher urgency (0-15 points)
- Geographic Factor: Ocean/remote areas = higher complexity (0-15 points)
```

### Data Quality Assessment
Multi-dimensional quality scoring:
- **Position Accuracy**: GPS precision and timestamp freshness
- **Telemetry Completeness**: All required parameters present
- **Temporal Validity**: Recency of last contact
- **Consistency Checks**: Validates against known aircraft performance

### SAR Urgency Classification
- **CRITICAL**: >24 hours since contact or emergency conditions
- **HIGH**: >6 hours since contact or over ocean
- **MEDIUM**: >1 hour since contact
- **LOW**: Recent contact, over land

## üîß Implementation Details

### Core Classes

#### `RealDataIngestor`
Main ingestion class with research-based prioritization:

```python
class RealDataIngestor:
    def __init__(self, openweather_api_key: Optional[str] = None)
    def build_real_simulation_input(self) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    def extract_best_sar_aircraft(self, opensky_data) -> Optional[AircraftState]
    def validate_aircraft_for_sar(self, aircraft) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

- Geographic caching (1-hour TTL)
- Automatic fallback to cached data

### Key Functions

#### `prioritize_aircraft_by_sar_criteria()`
Research-based aircraft prioritization considering:
- Cruise altitude aircraft (higher priority due to longer glide distance)
- High-speed aircraft (larger potential search radius)
- Aircraft over water/remote areas (harder to locate)
- Time since last contact (urgency factor)

#### `validate_aircraft_for_sar()`
Comprehensive data quality validation:
- Position accuracy verification
- Telemetry completeness scoring
- Temporal freshness assessment
- Physics-based consistency checks

## üîç Research-Based Features

### Uncertainty Modeling
Dynamic uncertainty calculation based on:
- **Time Factor**: Uncertainty increases with time since contact
- **Altitude Factor**: Higher altitude = greater position uncertainty

```python
uncertainty_radius = base_uncertainty + time_factor + altitude_factor
where:
- base_uncertainty = 1.0 nm
- time_factor = min(hours_since_contact * 0.5, 12.0) nm
- altitude_factor = (altitude_ft / 35000) * 2.0 nm
```
